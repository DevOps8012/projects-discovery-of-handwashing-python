Hi, I'm Rasmus Bååth and I'm an instructor at DataCamp.

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:10,460
So I've made a DataCamp project that will allow you to flex your pandas skills.

3
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,970
You'll reanalyze the data of Ignaz Semmelweis,

4
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:18,600
the Hungarian doctor who in the 1800s discovered handwashing.

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:24,170
Yes, there was a time when nobody washed their hands, not even doctors.

00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:28,620
Ok, so I hope you'll enjoy it, and good luck.
